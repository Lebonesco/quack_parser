was passing up errors,
but the return type was a pointer to an error struct
however I wasn't returing the error so it was
just returning nil


added new node type. was receiving bad error type
but was failing to bubble up error to top level because
I assumed the ast was working so wasn't checking for it
but was causing everything to fail
looked at git diff
then looked at top level node and added check then 
realized not checking on top


when creating the grammar realized that I could decrease the ambiguity of some important statements that would fix the rest
of my parsing issues 

learned that sometimes solving for the simple case opened
up my mind to solutions and configurations.
